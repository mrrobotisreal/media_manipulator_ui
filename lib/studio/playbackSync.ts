/**
 * Preview playback sync policy (MM70) — pure, no React, no DOM.
 *
 * The preview's playhead is the master clock (driven by the audio output
 * clock, see preview-surface.tsx). Every pooled media element is a slave that
 * must track `target` (its source position under the playhead). This module
 * decides, once per animation frame and per element, what to do about the
 * gap between the element and its target:
 *
 *   - hold   — leave it alone (in-flight seek, buffering, or settling);
 *   - rate   — nudge `playbackRate` by up to ±NUDGE_MAX_RATIO to close a small
 *              drift smoothly (video only; master audio is never stretched);
 *   - seek   — hard-seek, while playing to `target + measured seek latency`
 *              (a LEAD) so the element lands where the playhead will be when
 *              the seek completes, not where it was when it was issued;
 *   - defer  — paused/scrubbing: an exact seek is in flight, remember the
 *              newest target for the `seeked` handler to re-issue.
 *
 * Why (the MM70 bug): the previous policy hard-seeked to the CURRENT target
 * whenever drift exceeded 0.3 s. A seek takes L seconds to land (network round
 * trip for an unbuffered range + decoding from the previous keyframe), so it
 * always landed L behind; with L > 0.3 s that is already over the threshold,
 * so it seeked again — forever. The picture froze on each seek and never
 * caught up while the audio (cheap to seek, never drifting) played on; pausing
 * "fixed" it only because a paused target stops moving. Leads, cooldowns,
 * nudging, and stuck-state recovery below make that loop impossible.
