/**
 * versionCheckpoint — the client half of part 09's auto-checkpoint triggers
 * (ADR ws/0001 item 3): one checkpoint on editor open, then one per interval
 * tick *only when the document changed since the last landed checkpoint*.
 * (The "before export" trigger is server-side, in the ExportProject handler.)
 *
 * Pure timer/gating logic with injected callbacks so it is unit-testable with
 * fake timers — no store, no network. Checkpoints are a safety net, never a
 * gate on editing: a failure is swallowed after ONE silent early retry (the
 * next interval tick retries anyway, because the baseline only advances on
 * success).
 *
 * "Changed since last checkpoint" is a reference compare against the document
 * captured when the previous checkpoint landed. The store never mutates the
 * project object in place (every edit and every markSaved replaces it), so
 * identity is a sound cheap dirty flag; the rare false positive (markSaved
 * refreshing metadata) only ever follows a real edit, which deserved a
 * checkpoint anyway.
